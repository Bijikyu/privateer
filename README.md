# Privateer
This React CRUD web app enables businesses and creators to automatically have the web monitored for their products and brands in order to protect them from piracy and exploitation. When an offender is found, a cease and desist letter is sent out to the webmaster of the offending URL. All done in a fun nautical theme.

In the Age of Sail, privateers were pirate hunters, often little different than pirates themselves, who with the authority given to them by a government contract, plundered the wealth of the pirates they "neutralised."

**Technologies Used:** Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Token based auth, Paint.net.

**Getting Started:** [Link to the App](https://privateer.herokuapp.com/)

Once signed in, just click the large central button "Commission a Privateer" to choose the products and brands you want to protect, to set a bounty for succesful takedown, and tweak the standard cease and desist letter. Once your privateer is "commissioned" you will see them in the Fleet section of the main page. We are now monitoring the high seas (the web) in pursuit of your wayward contraband.

Want to protect additional products or brands? Commission additional privateers.
