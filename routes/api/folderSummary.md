The `privateers.js` file is a module that sets up API endpoints for managing "privateers" using the Express framework. It includes routes for listing all privateers, viewing a single privateer by ID, creating a new privateer, deleting a privateer by ID, and updating a privateer by ID. The module requires authentication for all routes and exports the configured router for use elsewhere in the application.

The `users.js` file is a module that defines routes for user authentication, specifically for signup and login operations. It uses the Express framework to create a router that handles POST requests to the `/signup` and `/login` endpoints, invoking the corresponding methods from the users controller. This router is also exported for use in other parts of the application.
