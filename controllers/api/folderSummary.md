The `privateers.js` file is a module that contains controller functions for managing a Privateer model, which likely represents entities such as ships or characters in a game or application. The module includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations specifically tailored to interact with a database, allowing users to list all privateers they have created, view a single privateer by ID, create new privateers, delete a privateer, and update existing privateers. The functions are designed to work with a logged-in user's context, ensuring that privateers are associated with the user who created them.

The `users.js` file is a module that provides authentication functionality for users. It includes functions for user login and signup processes, utilizing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage user sessions. The module handles user authentication by verifying email and password credentials, issuing JWTs upon successful login or signup, and setting token expiration to 24 hours. The module relies on a User model to interact with the user data and a SECRET environment variable for signing the JWTs.

In summary, `privateers.js` manages the lifecycle of Privateer entities for authenticated users, while `users.js` handles user authentication, allowing for secure user registration and login with token-based session management. Both modules are part of a larger application's backend, likely dealing with user accounts and their associated data.
