The `auth.js` file contains middleware for a Node.js application that authenticates HTTP requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It requires the `jsonwebtoken` package to decode and verify the tokens. The middleware function extracts the token from the Authorization header or query parameter, removes any 'Bearer ' prefix, and then verifies the token using a secret key obtained from environment variables. If the token is valid, the decoded user information is attached to the request object, allowing subsequent middleware to access the authenticated user's details. If verification fails, an error is passed to the next middleware.

The `database.js` file is responsible for configuring and establishing a connection to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library. It sets up the database connection with options to use the new URL parser, the new topology engine, and the updated index creation and modification methods. The connection details, including the database name and host information, are logged to the console once the connection is successfully established. The file ensures that the application can interact with the MongoDB database using Mongoose's features and methods.
