The `PrivateerListItem.jsx` file defines a React functional component that displays an individual item within a list of privateers. This component includes interactive elements such as links to view the details of a privateer and to navigate to an edit page, as well as a button to delete the privateer. The component uses the `react-router-dom` library to enable navigation between pages by passing the privateer's data through the link's state. The privateer's "booty" is displayed as part of the list item, and the delete button is wired to an event handler that triggers the deletion process using the privateer's unique identifier (`_id`). The component is styled with CSS classes and is exported for use elsewhere in the application.
