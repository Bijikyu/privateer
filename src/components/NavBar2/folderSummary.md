The `NavBar2.jsx` file defines a React functional component named `NavBar2` that renders a navigation bar with links that vary based on the user's authentication status. If a user is authenticated (indicated by the presence of a user object in the component's props), the navigation bar displays a welcome message with the user's name and a link to log out. If the user is not authenticated, the navigation bar provides links to log in and sign up pages. The component uses the `NavLink` component from `react-router-dom` to enable navigation within the application. The navigation bar's content is conditionally rendered using a ternary operator based on the user's authentication status. The `NavBar2` component is exported for use elsewhere in the application.
