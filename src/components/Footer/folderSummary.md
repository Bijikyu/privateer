The `Footer.jsx` file defines a React functional component named `Footer` that is responsible for rendering the footer section of a webpage. It imports the React library to enable JSX syntax and component functionality. The component itself is quite simple, consisting of a footer HTML element that contains a paragraph with a copyright notice for "Privateer Â© 2020 Brian Quezada." The component is designed to accept props, although none are explicitly used in the provided code. Finally, the Footer component is exported as the default export of the file, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the React application.
