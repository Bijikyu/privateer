The `NavBar.jsx` file defines a React functional component named `NavBar` that renders a navigation bar with links that vary depending on the user's authentication status. If a user is authenticated (`props.user` is truthy), the navigation bar includes an image logo, a site slogan, and NavLink components for 'Home' and 'Commission a Privateer' with exact path matching. If the user is not authenticated, only the image logo and site slogan are displayed. The component uses JSX syntax, React's NavLink for routing, and conditional rendering with a ternary operator to determine the content of the navigation bar. The `NavBar` component is styled with a className and is exported for use in other parts of the application.
