The provided JavaScript files are part of a web application that deals with user authentication and data management for an entity referred to as "privateers." Here's a summary of each file's functionality:

1. **privateerService.js**: This module contains functions to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on privateer data via an API. It interacts with the privateers API endpoint, using the base URL '/api/privateers'. The functions include:
   - `create`: Submits a POST request to create a new privateer entry.
   - `getAll`: Retrieves all privateer entries with a GET request.
   - `update`: Sends a PUT request to update an existing privateer entry.
   - `deleteOne`: Uses a DELETE request to remove a privateer entry by its ID.
   Each function utilizes the `tokenService` to handle authorization with JWT tokens.

2. **tokenService.js**: This module manages JWT tokens stored in the browser's local storage. It provides functions to set, get, and remove tokens, as well as to extract user information from a token. The functions include:
   - `setToken`: Saves a token to local storage.
   - `getToken`: Retrieves a token from local storage, checking for its validity and expiration.
   - `getUserFromToken`: Decodes a token to extract user information.
   - `removeToken`: Removes a token from local storage.

3. **userService.js**: This module handles user authentication processes, including signup, login, logout, and fetching the current user from the token. It uses the `tokenService` for token-related operations. The functions include:
   - `signup`: Registers a new user and stores the returned token.
   - `getUser`: Retrieves the current user's information from the stored token.
   - `logout`: Clears the user's token, effectively logging them out.
   - `login`: Authenticates a user with provided credentials and stores the returned token.

Overall, these files work together to manage user sessions and perform data operations on privateers, ensuring that interactions with the API are secure and authenticated using JWT tokens.
