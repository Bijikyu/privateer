The `SignupPage.jsx` file contains a React component named `SignupPage` which serves as a sign-up page interface. This component imports React and a `SignupForm` component from a specified path within the project. The `SignupPage` class extends React's `Component` class and initializes its state with a message property set to an empty string.

The component includes a constructor for setting up the initial state and an `updateMessage` function that updates the state with a new message when called. The `render` method returns JSX that includes a `div` element with the class name 'SignupPage', which contains the `SignupForm` component and a paragraph element for displaying messages.

The `SignupForm` is passed all of the `SignupPage` component's props along with the `updateMessage` function to allow for communication between the form and the page component. The message displayed is dynamically updated based on the component's state.

Finally, the `SignupPage` component is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
